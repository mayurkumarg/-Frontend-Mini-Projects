ðŸŽµ Audio Files
The audio files folder contains all the .mp3 music tracks used in this Spotify Clone project. Each audio file corresponds to a song listed in the appâ€™s song library (songs.json). These files are carefully organized to ensure smooth playback and easy maintenance.

All tracks are in .mp3 format for wide compatibility with modern browsers.

Each file is named clearly to match the song metadata for easy identification.

These audio files are the heart of the player, enabling instant streaming when a user clicks on a song.

Having all audio files stored locally helps in quick loading and offline testing during development.

This setup guarantees that the music player can deliver a seamless and enjoyable listening experience without relying on external servers or streaming services.
