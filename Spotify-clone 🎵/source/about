This project is built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

* **HTML (`.html`)** â†’ Structures the page layout and elements.
* **CSS (`.css`)** â†’ Styles the navigation, playlists, song cards, and player controls.
* **JavaScript (`.js`)** â†’ Adds interactivity, including:

  * Playing and pausing songs
  * Creating custom playlists
  * Searching with live suggestions

All source files are written in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS â€” no external frameworks â€” making the project lightweight and easy to understand.
